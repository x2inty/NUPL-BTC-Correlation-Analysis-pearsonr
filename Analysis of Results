Negative Correlation:

All correlations are negative, confirming an inverse relationship between NUPL peaks and subsequent BTC low prices in the following days.

The strength of the correlation varies slightly but remains generally weak to moderate (between -0.0436 and -0.1375).

Statistical Significance (p-value):

For timeframes of 0 to 20 days, the p-values are less than 0.05, indicating that the correlation is statistically significant. This means there is less than a 5% chance that this relationship is due to randomness.

For timeframes of 21 to 29 days, the p-values exceed 0.05, suggesting that the correlation is no longer statistically significant. The observed relationship could then be due to chance.

Optimal Timeframe:

The strongest correlation is observed for a 10-day timeframe (Correlation = -0.1374, P-value = 0.0041).

Timeframes of 0 to 20 days show significant correlations, but the strength of the correlation gradually decreases after 10 days.
