This code serves as a reference point for detecting only the most significant NUPL peaks within a defined time interval.

Solution with MIN_INTERVAL:

MIN_INTERVAL prevents the detection of peaks that are too close together, which could be noise.
It allows us to keep only the most significant peaks and avoid false signals.

Enforce a minimum interval of X days (MIN_INTERVAL = X) between two peaks to avoid duplicates and keep only the most significant points.

Concretely, the code works like this:

1_ It selects the first peak that meets the conditions.

2_ It ignores all other peaks that occur within the next 5 days.

3_ If a new peak appears after 5 days, it is considered.

Solution with Variation (VARIATION_MIN):

VARIATION_MIN is used to identify true peaks by filtering out minor fluctuations in NUPL.

VARIATION_MIN represents the minimum variation in NUPL required to consider a point as a peak.

If NUPL increases or decreases by at least VARIATION_MIN, it is a potential peak.

Otherwise, it is a minor fluctuation that is ignored.

Exemple:
If VARIATION_MIN = 0.02 (2%), a peak is valid if NUPL varies by more than 2% before or after that point.

If VARIATION_MIN = 0.05 (5%), we filter out even more minor fluctuations and detect fewer, but more significant, peaks.

Effect of VARIATION_MIN on Results:
**If a small value is chosen (VARIATION_MIN = 0.01):**

1_ Many peaks are captured, but some may be noise.

2_ Every small rise or fall will be considered a peak.**

**If a larger value is chosen (VARIATION_MIN = 0.05):

1_Minor fluctuations are filtered out, and only true peaks are kept.

2_Only major trend movements are captured.
